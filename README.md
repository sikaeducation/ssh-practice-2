# SSH Practice 2

* Generate a new SSH key
* Add it to this server
* SSH into it
* Search the first 15 lines of the `people.txt` file for the line containing the word "Sarah" and append it to the end of the `friends.txt` file
* Make the "friend-processor" command executable by anyone and use friends.txt an input to it in one command
* Determine whether a program called `friends` is installed on the server.
